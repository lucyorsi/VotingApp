## Crypto stuff

### Contribute
Install TypeScript:
```
$ npm install -g typescript
```

Make your changes in `crypto/vote.ts`. Then do:
```
$ cd crypto
$ tsc vote.ts
```

This will compile the TypeScript into JS and replace the file `vote.js`.

Also borrowing a bit from this paper: [Electronic Voting Schemes](http://bezadis.ics.upjs.sk/old/files/other/rjaskova.pdf).
